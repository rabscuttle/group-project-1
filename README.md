## Project Title: Variables Influencing Special Education Enrollment

### Team Members: Amanda Stambaugh, Katie Welter, Kelli Roddy, Scott Rehn

## Project Description/Outline: 

In our work with some of the most challenging special education students in the state, there are several ad hoc hypotheses about how environmental and demographic factors affect special education identification and enrollment.  We would like to investigate some of these theories to see if any of these factors have a statistically significant impact on special education enrollment by district in the state of Minnesota.

Research Questions to Answer:
Factors that could correlate to the number of students receiving special education services by district.
1. Do districts with higher poverty rates have higher rates of identified special education students? 
2. Does population density correlate with the percentage of identified special education students?
3. Do districts with a higher rate of students of color have a higher rate of identified special education students? 
4. Do districts with a higher rate of English language learners have a higher rate of identified special education students? 

Datasets to Be Used:
1. Minnesota Department of Education
	Student File 18-19 https://drive.google.com/file/d/17r_c8mnE_X-URqGQjLwELsZrIngHVvOH/view?usp=sharing
2. Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/)
	https://api.census.gov/data.html
	School district names https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/guidance-geographies/districts-counties.html

		Variable numbers - 
			Race - B02001_001E thru 010E
			Total Population - B010003_001E
			Poverty Status - B17001_001E thru 002E


Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Get data (using 1 Jupyter Notebook)
2. Get .csv files
3. Clean datasets
4. Merge census data with MDE data

Analyze data (using 1 Jupyter Notebook)
1. Run linear regression and other analysis on each potential variable.
2. T-test race/ethnicity
3. Report our findings
