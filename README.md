Project Title: Variables Influencing Special Education Enrollment

Team Members: Amanda Stambaugh, Katie Welter, Kelli Roddy, Scott Rehn

Project Description/Outline: 

In our work with some of the most challenging special education students in the state, there are several ad hoc hypotheses about how environmental and demographic factors affect special education identification and enrollment.  We would like to investigate some of these theories to see if any of these factors have a statistically significant impact on special education enrollment by district in the state of Minnesota.

Research Questions to Answer: Factors that could correlate to the number of students receiving special education services by district.
Poverty (Census) - Do districts with high poverty rates have higher rates of identified special education students?
Population Density (Census) - Does population density correlate with the percentage of  identified special education students?
Race/ethnicity distribution (MDE) - Do districts with a higher rate of students of color have a higher rate of identified special education students?
Follow-up if time - Look for districts with statistically different racial distribution from the state distribution; tie in special ed somehow

Datasets to Be Used:
